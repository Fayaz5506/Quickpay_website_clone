          <p>
            Denmark's Payment Services Act is currently
            being revised, with Dankort. Introduced in 1983,
            at the centre of the debate. The government
            intends to enhance competition and
            transparency in the payments market, which
            could have significant implications for both
            webshops and physical stores. Here's an
            overview for webshop owners.

          <h3>Subscription payments can now continue even when a payment card expires.</h3>
          <p>
            Does it trouble your business when subscription
            customers change or lose their payment cards?
            In addition to the possibility of payment failure,
            there's a risk that some customers might cancel
            their subscriptions, which can lead to a loss of
            revenue for your business. Therefore, starting in
            early 2025, we will support tokenized payments,
            ensuring that subscription payments continue
            uninterrupted.
